Here the Basics of Linux that every linux user should know. 


Linux System: 

cat /etc/*release               # Linux version or flavours
uname -r                        # Kernel version
uptime                          # How long system has been up
cat /proc/cmdline               # Kernel parameters at the boot time
vmstat 1 5                      # Virtual memory usage top 5 in every 1 sec
mpstat 1 5                      # CPU usage top 5 in every 1 sec
ps -ef                          # All the process those are running in the system
ps -ef | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c      # Most used services by user
pidstat 1 5                     # To check what services are executing in every 1 sec and top 5 services
iostat -xz 1 5                  # Top 5 most cpu and disk used by the processes
sar -n DEV 1 5                  # Network usage and load of the system
sar -n TCP,ETCP 1 5             # To check TCP packets and errors
ls /boot/vm*                    # To check the kernel old versions
dpkg -l | wc -l                 # Number counts of packages installed in system
dpkg -l | grep -i ssh           # To check the packages version and other details
fdisk -l | grep -i vd           # To check the physical disk partition
lsblk                           # To check the physical disk partition (alternative)
blkid                           # Partition id and other details


Networking IP and Ports:

ipaddr                          # To check IP address and network interfaces
